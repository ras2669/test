# Principles of Data Science
This course builds on the principles of computing to introduce students to data analytics
techniques commonly performed on digital data sets, using a variety of software tools.
Students will learn what constitutes data and its associated social, ethical, and privacy
concerns, common data acquisition and preparation techniques, and how to perform
exploratory data analysis on real-world datasets from several domains. Common statistical
and machine learning techniques, including regression, classification, clustering, and
association rule mining will be covered. In addition, students will learn the importance of
applying visualization for presenting and analyzing data. Students will be required to
demonstrate oral and written communication skills through critical thinking homework
assignments and both presenting and writing a detailed report for a project to analyze a data
set of their choice.
